Hello everyone! I am Deven Mistry. I am a graduate student at the University of Cincinnati. I am currently working on my thesis. I am advised by [Dr. Ali Minai](https://www.ceas3.uc.edu/profiles/minaiaa). I am relatively new to the field of the deep learning.

Currently, I am working as a Software Engineer Intern at [Global Quality Corp](http://gqc.com/). I work under the supervision of [Dr. Sudhir Kshirsagar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-sudhir-kshirsagar-47a9903?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAACtt54B7bA7svJpRLVTRcBQyQiGaV73U0c&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BXOKe37h7Ram0s8bpvTfIrQ%3D%3D). Here, I am working on interesting projects on image segmentation, image classification. I even got to participate in a NLP hackathon, where we built a Market Sentiment Predictor by analyzing tweets of influential tech personalities.

My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision and various topics in Machine Learning. Besides that as an individual, I have varied interests ranging from cooking, reading about psychology, physics, philosophy and playing instruments.

I am also a trained classical musician. I play the Indian classical instrument called Tabla.
