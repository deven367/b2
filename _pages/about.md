Hello everyone! I am Deven Mistry. I am graduate student at the University of Cincinnati. I am currently working on my thesis. I am advised by Ali Minai. I am relatively new to field of deep learning.

My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing. Besides that as an individual, I have varied interests ranging from cooking, reading about psychology, physics, philosophy and playing instruments.

I am also a trained classical musician. I play the Indian classical instrument called Tabla.
